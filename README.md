# Cozy Spring Jam 2023

This repository acts as an entry to [Cozy Spring Jam 2023](https://itch.io/jam/cozy-spring-jam-2023-) on itch.io.

### Personal note from [ctrlsquid](https://github.com/ctrlsquid) (maintainer)

You'll find a bit of project history before and after the jam itself. I'm trying to reframe from actually starting what
I want to be the main game in the spirit of the jam.
The reason I am doing some work before is primarily because this is my first video game and I wanted to try out
using [bevy](https://bevyengine.org/).
